# Image Stiching Project
* ORB feature detector and descriptor is used to describe the image.
* RANSAC is used for feature matching in order to find the transformation matrix.
* Cross-correlation is used for performance metric.

## Requirements & Dependences:
This project is implemented with the following libraries:
* OpenCV 4.7.0
* Rasterio 1.3.6
